### Abstract

Depression stands as a significant public health challenge, contributing substantially
to disability rates globally. Traditional approaches to monitoring and surveillance
of depression often face delays and resource constraints, hindering timely
interventions. In South Africa, research on the prevalence and determinants of depression
remains limited, posing challenges for designing targeted interventions
and allocating resources effectively. This research aims to address these gaps by
leveraging machine learning models and socioeconomic data from the National Income
Dynamics Study to predict the likelihood of depression among individuals
in South Africa. The proposed methodology involves preprocessing and preparing
the National Income Dynamics Study dataset, including labeling participants for
depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Various
machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, deep neural
networks, and support vector machines, will be explored and evaluated. The
top-performing models will be rigorously validated and tuned to optimize their
predictive capabilities. Additionally, the relative importance of different socioeconomic
and demographic features in predicting depression likelihood will be analyzed.
By providing a novel and potentially complementary approach to depression
surveillance, this research aims to enhance our understanding of the socioeconomic
factors associated with depression in the South African context. The findings
may inform evidence-based strategies for mitigating the burden of depression and
guide resource allocation for mental health interventions in the region.

### Research Question

Can machine learning models effectively predict the likelihood of depression among
individuals in South Africa using socio-economic and demographic data from the
National Income Dynamics Study?

### Research Aims and Objectives

#### Aims
The aim of this research is to develop machine learning models that can accurately
predict the likelihood of depression among individuals in South Africa by utilizing
socio-economic, demographic, and health-related data from the National Income
Dynamics Study (NIDS) dataset.

#### Objectives
The objectives of the research are:
1. To preprocess and prepare the NIDS dataset for machine learning analysis,
including labeling participants for depression using the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression (CES-D) scale.
2. To explore and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms
in predicting depression risk from the NIDS data.
3. To rigorously validate and tune the top-performing machine learning models
to optimize their predictive capabilities for depression.
4. To analyze the relative importance of different socio-economic and demographic
features in the models for predicting depression likelihood.
5. To assess the potential real-world applicability and impact of using the developed
machine learning models for depression surveillance and risk estimation
in South Africa.

### Limitations

There are a number of limitations that can be described from the current approach
of the research, relating to its scope. These can be split into different areas:

#### Practical Limitations:
- Implementing these machine learning models in real-world settings for depression
surveillance and risk assessment may face technical, logistical, and
resource challenges.
- Privacy and ethical concerns around using personal socio-economic data for
mental health predictions could limit the adoption and scalability of such
models.

#### Interpretation Limitations:
- While the models may identify important predictive features, establishing
causal relationships between socio-economic factors and depression risk may
require further study.
- The interpretability of complex machine learning models can be limited, making
it challenging to fully understand how predictions are being made. For
medical professionals in the industry, this might be an unappealing aspect
of this approach, since it is quite likely that they would want to understand
exactly why the model was making its decisions.

#### Methodology Limitations:
The NIDS dataset, while comprehensive, may not capture all relevant socio-economic,
demographic, and health factors that could influence depression risk. There may
be important variables missing from the dataset. Moreover, the dataset is limited to
South Africa, which could affect the generalizability of the findings and models to
other countries or regions with different socio-economic and cultural contexts.

Furthermore, Machine learning models are ultimately based on the data used to
train them. If there are biases or inaccuracies in the NIDS data, these could be reflected
in the model predictions.

Importantly, the process of labeling participants for depression using the CES-D
scale may not capture the full complexity and nuances of depressive disorders. The
CES-D scale itself is not a clinical or medical diagnosis for depression, it is a selfreporting
measure and should be treated as such for the purpose of this research.

### Ethical Considerations

**Data Privacy and Consent**: The use of personal socio-economic and health data for
machine learning models raises concerns about data privacy and the need for informed
consent from participants. Participantsâ€™ data in the NIDS surveys is anonymized, abiding by these privacy rules. However, ethical approval/clearance for
the use of the NIDS datasets will be required.

**Ethical Use of Predictive Models**: The development of predictive models for depression
risk raises ethical questions about how these models will be used, particularly
in terms of potential discrimination or stigmatization. Clear guidelines and
governance frameworks should be established to ensure the ethical and responsible
use of these models, avoiding unintended consequences or harm.
